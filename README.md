# Taxi-Fare-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest
This project predicts taxi fares based on various trip details such as pickup and dropoff locations, passenger count, and other relevant features. The model is trained using the Random Forest algorithm, and an interactive Streamlit app is created to allow users to input trip details and receive fare predictions.
